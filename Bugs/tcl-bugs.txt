X When an error occurs during assembly, the error window should turn
	red (or something like that) and the line mentioned in the
	error message should be highlighted in the edit window.
	
X (Related to the previous) After assembly, if there was an error, the
	cursor should move to the start of the line that the assembler
	error was on.  If there was no error, the cursor should not
	move.

- An ANT logo in the tool bar would be very cool....  Especially if
	was animated and ran around from time to time.  But this is
	very silly...

X The toolbar in the Edit and Debug window seem different-- the
	padding around the buttons is different (in the debug window,
	there seems to be more vertical space and less horizontal.  I
	like this better.

X Command-line arg to aide should be name of .asm file, and that file
	should come up in the editor

X The "load" command in tcl should be replaced with something that is
	smart enough to know where to find the libraries if they are not
	in the current directory!

+ When the editor window is resized, the editor textarea (and the rest
	of the widgets in this window) should do something sensible.
