	UNIX INSTALLATION NOTES FOR ANT 3.1.0

The UNIX binary distributions consist of a single gzip'd tar archive,
with a name like ant8-3.1.0-FreeBSD_4.3_RELEASE_p22-i386.tgz.  The
name of the archive consists of four "fields" seperated by dashes. 
The first is the product type, which is either ant8 or ant32.  The
second is derived from the version of ANT (3.1.0), and the third and
fourth are the name and release number of the operating system
(FreeBSD_4.3_RELEASEp22), and the hardware architecture that the
binaries are intended for (i386).

Release numbers that end in "a" indicate a development or prerelease
distribution.  Release numbers that end in "b" indicate a distribution
that is undergoing final testing before release. 

To install the ANT tools on UNIX, ungzip'ing this archive and
extracting its contents via tar should be all that is necessary.  If
DIST is the name of the distribution archive you are installing, the
following command suffices on most systems:

	gunzip -c DIST | tar xfp -

This will install the distribution as a subdirectory named either
ant8-3.1.0 or ant32-3.1.0 in the current directory, depending on which
product (ant8 or ant32) is installed.

The contents of the install directory will depend on the product
installed; the names of the files installed for ant8 and ant32 differ. 
This directory will include (at least) the following files and
directories:

/bin/		- location of the ANT executables
/doc/		- tutorials and documentation for the tools
/examples/	- simple example programs
/arch_name	- more detailed info about the host that created
			this distribution

Once you have installed ANT, you can rename or move the installation
directory to something more convenient (such as /usr/local/ant-3.1)
or create symlinks to accomplish the same thing.

Note that the version of aide8 that is part of ANT-3.1.0 assumes that
version 8 of the TCL and TK libraries are installed on your system. 
The aide program will not work without the correct version of these
libraries.  If you are running aide on solaris, you may need to add
the directory where these libraries are located to your
LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

If you encounter any problems, or have any questions or suggestions,
please send email to ant-help@eecs.harvard.edu.
