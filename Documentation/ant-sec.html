<H1>CS50 1997 - Architecture and ANT </H1>

By this point in the course, you have probably started to form some
suspicions about what's really going on inside the computer, and how
the high-level statements you're allowed to use in <B>C</B> are
actually executed.  Today we'll explore this subject in more depth,
first by discussing some aspects of computer architecture in general,
and then by spending time talking about ANT, a specific architecture. 
Finally, you are given the job of implementing an ANT.  <P>

<HR>
<H2>Computer Architecture</H2>

<H3>Computer components</H3>

There are three main components in a computer, from an architectural
point of view: <P>

<DL>

<DT><EM>CPU</EM> <P>

<DD> The CPU (or <EM>Central Processing Unit</EM>) is the "brain" of
	the computer.  It contains the mechanisms that actually
	perform the computations that the computer does on your
	behalf.  <P>

<DT> <EM>Memory</EM> <P>

<DD> The memory (also called <EM>RAM</EM>, which stands for <EM>Random
	Access Memory</EM>) is the scratch paper that the CPU uses to
	store data and partial results from computations that are in
	progress.  <P>

        Note that the CPU often contains some small amount of scratch
        memory as well.  This memory is usually called
        <EM>registers</EM>.  In most architectures, the registers are
        treated quite differently than other memory, but a few
        architectures treat them in similar ways.  <P>

<DT> <EM>I/O Devices</EM> <P>

<DD> I/O (which stands for <EM>Input/Output</EM>) is the mechanism
	that the CPU uses to input data, either directly to the CPU or
	into memory, from file, keyboard, network, or other external
	devices, to output data to files, the screen, network, or
	other external devices.  <P>

	It may seem odd for contemporary users to refer to a file as
	an external device, since for computers like PCs and Macs,
	files are stored on disks that generally reside inside the
	computer.  Similarly, the screen and keyboard are also tightly
	integrated with most contemporary computers, so that it's
	difficult to imagine a computer without a keyboard and screen
	(and mouse and disk...).  What is really referred to by
	"input" and "output" is the movement of data with respect to
	the CPU and RAM and other devices in the system- not whether
	the data actually enters or exits the box that houses the
	computer.  <P>

</DL>

<H3>The CPU</H3>

In general, a CPU contains the following pieces: <P>

<DL>

<DT> <EM>Register File</EM> <P>

<DD> The register file is a small set of memory locations that can
	each be used to store a single item (usually a character,
	integer, or a floating point number).  <P>

<DT> <EM>Control</EM> <P>

<DD> The control logic decides what operation in the program to
	perform next.  <P>

        Each program, by the time the CPU gets it, is broken down into
        a sequence of operations.  By default, the control logic is
        quite simple- execute the operations in the sequence that
        appear in the program.  However, the control logic can also
        execute the operations in a sequence that is computed as the
        part of the program itself- for example, with the <B>C</B>
        <KBD>if</KBD> statement.  <P>

<DT> <EM>Datapath</EM> <P>

<DD> The datapath is where the action actually takes place.  Data it
	taken from a register or registers, operated upon, and the
	results are placed back into a register (or registers).  <P>

	One component of the datapath is the <EM>ALU</EM> (the
	<EM>Arithmetic Logic Unit</EM>), which is the brain of the CPU
	(just as the CPU is the brain of the computer).  The ALU is
	responsible for computing the mathematical functions that
	actually implement the arithmetic and logic operations that
	the CPU executes.  It may seem quite surprising that all of
	the operations that the CPU can compute reduce to a small set
	of logical and arithmetic functions, but this is actually
	the case. <P>

        </DL>

<H3>Memory Organization</H3>

<UL>

<LI> The easiest way to think of memory is as a huge 1-dimensional
	array of bytes.  (For some architectures, things are not quite
	so simple, but this is generally sufficient.) <P>

<LI> The most important thing to keep in mind is that memory is simply
	sequences of bytes.  What these bytes represent is up to the
	application to determine.  In the reading, conventions for
	representing numbers and characters are described, but it's up
	to the application to keep track of what convention to use. 
	<P>

	If someone hands you four bytes containing some arbitrary bit
	pattern, and then asks you what they represent, you can't
	answer without more information.  It could be four characters,
	two 16-bit integers, a 32-bit integer, a floating point
	number- and of characters, integers, and floating point
	numbers have more than one convention for representation, so
	the number of possible interpretations is gigantic.  However,
	if someone hands you four bytes containing some arbitrary bit
	pattern, and then asks what 32-bit two's-complement integer
	they represent, then you should be able to answer them!  <P>

</UL>

<HR>
<H2>ANT</H2>

For this assignment, you need to write a small amount of ANT assembly
language.  At first, the programs may seem daunting, but if you attack
them methodically and carefully, they should not present any major
difficulties.  <P>

You may have heard some remarks about how unpleasant assembly
programming can be, and it certainly is not something that you want to
do forever.  However, it can be an interesting thing to do, and a lot
of fun in the short run.  <P>


<H3>A Guide to Writing in Assembly</H3>

<OL>

<LI> <EM> Define your algorithm.</EM> <P>

	For this assignment, we give you the precise algorithms for
	the code you need to write, so this shouldn't be a problem. 
	You may find it useful to modify these algorithms slightly, in
	order to express them in ANT, but make sure that you have the
	basic ideas totally nailed down before diving into the code. 
	<P>

<LI> <EM> Write your program in <KBD>C</KBD> (or at least in
	pseudo-C).</EM> <P>

	If you can't precisely specify what it is that your algorithm
	is supposed to do and how to do it, then there's little chance
	you'll get it right be tinkering with it in assembly language. 
	Since the beginning of the semester, you have been learning
	how to express algorithms precisely by writing them in
	<KBD>C</KBD>.  Use this experience!  <P>

	Note that the most appropriate or elegant algorithms in C may
	not be the most appropriate or elegant algorithms in ANT. 
	Think about what is going to be easiest to express in ANT; it
	may change your algorithm.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Study the <KBD>ANT</KBD> references and look over the
	examples from lecture and the course notes.</EM> <P>

	If you don't know how to express yourself in ANT, then even
	the best algorithm is doomed to failure.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Divide the algorithm into smaller and smaller pieces.</EM>
	<P>

	Eventually, each piece of the algorithm should start to look
	like something that you can easily convert into a sequence of
	<KBD>ANT</KBD> instructions and/or data declarations.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Decide what temporary variables you need, choose registers
	to keep them all in, and document this. </EM> <P>

	Do this <EM> before</EM> you write any code, and once you
	start to write code be very reluctant to change the register
	allocations without good reason!  If you change the meaning of
	a register in one part of your code, you may need to change
	many other parts of your code in order to avoid clobbering
	something else.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Don't try to write everything at once.</EM> <P>

	Write small pieces that you can check and test carefully.  An
	example of this in included later in this handout.  <P>

	Make use of the ANT debugger (<B>ad</B>) to test your code. 
	You can execute your code line by line, checking to make sure
	that what is in the registers and data memory is what you
	expect after each step.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Learn the debugger. </EM> <P>

	ANT comes with a decent debugger.  Learn your way around
	it!  You will not be able to debug your programs by
	staring at them- most people find the debugger invaluable
	(the rest find ANT programming impossible, because they
	can't find their bugs without using the debugger). <P>

	The debugger takes minutes to learn and can save you hours of
	frustration.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Use <KBD>checkin</KBD> early and often, and use scratch
	files.</EM> <P>

	Make sure you keep track of what each scratch file is used for
	(i.e.  what idea you were experimenting with in it) so you can
	pick out the good stuff later.  There's no reason why the
	programs you need to write for this assignment should be the
	only ANT programs you ever write!  <P>

</OL>

<H3>Arrays in ANT</H3>

In assembly, arrays are just a pointer to the first element in the
array.  If you want to get at the <EM>n</EM>th item in an array,
you'll need to compute the address of that item.  The general
calculation, in C-like notation is: <P>

<PRE>
	/* Address calculation in assembler:		*/
	/* NOTE: this is different from address		*/
	/*	calculation in C!			*/
	&A [x] == &A [0] + (x * sizeof (each element of A));
</PRE> <P>

In ANT, this all greatly simplified by the fact that the size of each
element (at least for arrays of bytes, which are all you need to worry
about for this assignment) is exactly one.  Therefore, this reduces to
the following more C-like expression:

<PRE>
	&A [x] == &A [0] + x;
		/* or just */
	&A [x] == A + x;
</PRE> <P>

So, let's imagine that you need to get at the <EM>n</EM>th element of
<KBD>A</KBD>, where the address of the first element of <KBD>A</KBD>
is stored in <KBD>r2</KBD> and <EM>n</EM> is stored in <KBD>r3</KBD>,
and put it into <KBD>r5</KBD>.  Note that this example uses
<KBD>r4</KBD> as scratch space.  <P>

<PRE>
	lc	r2, $A		# r2 = A;
	add	r4, r2, r3	# r4 = A + n;
	ld	r5, r4, 0	# r5 = *(A + n);
</PRE> <P>

Placing a value into <KBD>A[n]</KBD> is done in the same manner,
except that the <KBD>ld</KBD> is replaced with a <KBD>st</KBD>.  <P>

There are a few examples of strolling through arrays in the code we
offer as examples: <KBD>reverse.asm</KBD> is pretty clear, and of
course there is always the silly <KBD>bigadd.asm</KBD>.  <P>

<HR>
<H2>Creating Your Very Own ANT</H2>

With any luck, this could be the most rewarding and fun assignment of
the semester.  You will implement most of the important aspects of a
realistic virtual machine.  A few weeks ago, you may have known
nothing about computers, but now you know enough to create your own! 
(You might find this boring, but to me this seems exciting.) <P>

Some guidelines that you might find useful: <P>

<UL>

<LI> <EM> You will probably find it easier to write your ant after you
	do the ANT programming part of the assignment.  </EM> <P>

	This will familiarize you with how the machine works, and
	should give you ideas of how to proceed.  Once you are
	familiar with using the instructions, when it comes time to
	implement the same instructions yourself, you'll already know
	what they're supposed to do.  <P>

<LI> <EM> You cannot avoid the reading.  </EM> <P>

	<B> I cannot stress this enough.  </B> <P>

	Read the assignment, then <KBD>ant_design.txt</KBD> and
	<KBD>ant.txt</KBD> cover to cover.  We've provided a lot of
	code for you, and also a lot of documentation.  The amount of
	code that you have to write for this assignment is actually
	relatively small- but if you don't understand what you're
	supposed to do and what we've done for you, it could seem like
	mountains of code.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Don't put off the reading.  </EM> <P>

	Read the documentation early, so that if you are confused by
	some part of it, you can ask questions <B>early</B> (long
	before the assignment is due) and get a clear understanding of
	things before you go on to the next step.  <P>

	Read through <KBD>ant_design.txt</KBD>.  It describes the code
	that we give you.  Once you understand this code, you'll
	realized that we did most of the hard work for you, and
	there's relatively little left for you to write.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Design.  </EM> <P>

	The design should be simple.  Don't "over-engineer" the
	design; just do something simple that works.  I promise you
	that there are a variety of approaches, all simple (and of
	course some difficult ones as well).  Simple is always better. 
	<P>

<LI> <EM> Think about the design questions.  </EM> <P>

	Don't leave the design questions until after you have finished
	coding!  Looking at them first might give you ideas about how
	to do the coding- and doing the coding with them in mind will
	help you to find answers to them.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Implement incrementally.  </EM> <P>

	This is more of a general rule than a guideline specific to
	this assignment, but it is especially easy to do here.  After
	you implement each instruction, write a tiny program (or use
	one of the ones we supply) to test whether it works.  <P>

	If you start with the <KBD>sys</KBD> instruction (and
	particularly the <KBD>dump</KBD> syscall), that will make this
	even easier.  <P>

<LI> <EM> Test.  </EM> <P>

	We've provided a test facility called <KBD>test-ant</KBD> that
	does a decent test to see whether your ant matches the spec. 
	It's not a perfect test (and can't test every tiny detail) but
	if your ant passes all the tests, it's not bad.  <P>

	The test is constantly being refined; keep your eyes peeled
	for improvements.  <P>

</UL>

<H3> Random Implementation Notes </H3>

<OL>

<LI> There are a lot of things that can go wrong with the
	<KBD>get_int</KBD> syscall.  That's why the spec is so shaky-
	if the user types in a valid integer in the range from -128 to
	127, your ANT should be able to deal with it, but if they type
	in some garbage, or something too large or too small, or any
	other sort of nonsense, then <B>the results are undefined</B>. 
	This was done to make your life easier.  <P>

<LI> There are a few errors that you need to check for over and over
	again, on most of the instructions.  Perhaps you should make a
	function to do this error check.  <P>

</OL>
