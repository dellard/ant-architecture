\chapter{Examples}

The following sections include the source code for
several of the programs referenced by the tutorial.
All of this source code is also available online.

For the convenience of the reader,
the source code is listed here
along with line numbers in the left margin.
These line numbers do not appear in the original code,
and it would be an error to include them in your own code.
