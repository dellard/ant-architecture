\section{{\sc Ant-8} Architecture Overview}

The {\sc Ant-8} architecture is a load/store architecture; the only
instructions that can access memory are the {\em load} and {\em store}
instructions.  All other operations access only registers (or, in the
case of {\tt in} and {\tt out}, access peripherals).

The {\sc Ant-8} CPU has 16 registers, named {\tt r0} through {\tt r15}.
Register {\tt r0} always contains the constant 0, and register
{\tt r1} is used to hold results related to previous operations
(described later).  {\tt r0} and {\tt r1} are {\em read-only}.
They can be used as destination registers, but their values are
unchanged.
The other 14 registers ({\tt r2} through {\tt r15}) are
general-purpose registers.

\section{Instructions}
\label{mnemonic-sec}

In the description of the instructions, the notation described in
the following table is used:

\vspace{3mm}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|lp{5.5in}|}
\hline
{\em des}       & Must always be a register. The {\em des} register
			may be modified by the instruction. \\
{\em reg}       & Must always be a register. \\
{\em src1}      & Must always be a register. \\
{\em src2}      & Must always be a register. \\
{\em const8}     & Must be an 8-bit constant (-128 .. 127):
			an integer (signed), char, or label. \\
{\em uconst8}	& Must be an 8-bit constant (0 .. 255):
			an integer (unsigned) or label. \\
{\em uconst4}	& Must be a 4-bit constant integer (0 .. 15). \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\vspace{3mm}

The {\sc Ant-8} assembly language instructions are listed in Figure
\ref{mnemonic-table}.

Note that for all instructions, register {\tt r1} is always
updated {\em after} the rest of the instruction is done,
so that it is always safe to use {\tt r1} as a source register.

\hline
        {\tt add}       & {\em des, src1, src2} &
                {\em des} gets {\em src1} + {\em src2}.
                {\tt r1} gets 1 if the result is $>$ 127,

        {\tt sub}       & {\em des, src1, src2} &
                {\em des} gets {\em src1} - {\em src2}.

        {\tt mul}       & {\em des, src1, src2} &
                Multiply {\em src1} and {\em src2},
                leaving the low-order byte in register {\em des}

                {\em des} gets the bitwise logical {\sc and} of
                {\em src1} and {\em src2}.  {\tt r1} gets the

\hline
        {\tt shf}        & {\em des, src1, src2} &
		{\em des} gets the bitwise shift of {\em src1} by

		{\em src1} is shifted to the left, if {\em src2}
		is negative {\em src1} is shifted to the right. \\

	Add {\em const8} to the specified register.
                {\tt r1} gets 1 if the result is $>$ 127,
		-1 if $<$ -128, or 0 otherwise. \\
\hline

{\tt in}	& {\em des, uconst4}	&
	Read in a byte from the peripheral specified by {\em uconst4},

	if successful, 1 if EOI is reached.
	\\

\subsection{{\sc Ant-8} Peripherals}
\label{peripheral-sec}

The {\tt in} and {\tt out} operations set {\tt r1} to 0 if successful,
and set {\tt r1} to non-zero values to indicate failure.
