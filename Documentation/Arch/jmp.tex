\OneRegisterOp{jmp}{Jump}{\OPCODE}{(ignored)}{const8}

\index{jmp@{\tt jmp}!for Ant-8}

Jump to a constant address.

\begin{enumerate}

\item \Reg{1} $\leftarrow$ {\sc PC}.

	Note that {\sc PC} has already been incremented, and so the
	value left in \Reg{1} is set to the address of the instruction
	following the currently executing instruction.

\item {\sc PC} $\leftarrow$ {\em const8}.

\end{enumerate}

{\em const8} is treated as an unsigned 8-bit integer.
