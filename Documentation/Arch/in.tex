\TwoRegisterOp{in}{Input}{\OPCODE}{reg}{\em unused}{uconst4}

\index{in@{\tt in} for Ant-8}

The {\tt in} instruction is used to perform input
of a single character from a peripheral device.

The 4 bits of the {\em uconst4} determine the ``peripheral'' from which
the byte is read.  The standard Ant-8 implementation has three
peripherals:

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt 0000}] Hexadecimal --
	the value is treated as a two-digit hexadecimal number.

\item[{\tt 0001}] Binary --
	the value is treated as an eight-digit binary number.

\item[{\tt 0010}] {\sc ASCII} --
	the value is interpreted as an ASCII character code.

\end{description}

\begin{itemize}

\item \Reg{reg} $~ \leftarrow$ one byte read from the input, in one of
	the formats.

\item \Reg{1} $~ \leftarrow$ 1 if end-of-input (EOI) has been reached,
	0 otherwise.

\end{itemize}
