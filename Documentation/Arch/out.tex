\TwoRegisterOp{out}{Output}{\OPCODE}{\em unused}{reg}{uconst4}

\index{out@{\tt out} for Ant-8}

The {\tt out} instruction is used to perform output
of a single character to a peripheral device. {\tt r1} is
set to zero.

The 4 bits of the {\em uconst4} determine the ``peripheral'' to which
the byte is written.  The standard Ant-8 implementation has three
peripherals:

\begin{description}

\item[{\tt 0000}] Hexadecimal --
	the value is treated as a two-digit hexadecimal number.

\item[{\tt 0001}] Binary --
	the value is treated as a eight-digit binary number.

\item[{\tt 0010}] {\sc ASCII} --
	the value is interpreted as an {\sc ASCII} character code.

\end{description}
