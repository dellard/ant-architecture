\ThreeRegisterOp{ld1}{Load one byte}{\OPCODE}{des}{src1}{uconst4}

\index{ld1@{\tt ld1}!for Ant-8}

Load a value from memory into \Reg{des}.

Note that \Reg{src1} is treated as an unsigned value
		(\MinUIntWord $\cdots ~$ \MaxUIntWord).

\begin{enumerate}

\item If \Reg{src1} + {\em uconst4} $> ~$ \MaxUIntWord,
	an "invalid address" error occurs and the processor halts.
	{\em uconst4} is treated
	as an unsigned 4-bit integer, while \Reg{src1} is treated as
	an unsigned 8-bit value.

\item The 8-bit number located at data memory position
	(\Reg{src1} + {\em uconst4})
	is loaded into \Reg{des}.

\end{enumerate}
