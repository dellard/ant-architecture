	Seed the random number generator with the 96-bit number formed
	by concatenating the three src registers.  The initial seed,
	when the CPU is initialized, is always 0.

	It is implementation-defined how many of the 96 possible bits
	are actually used to seed the random number generator. The
	{\em info} instruction can be used to detect how many bits
	of the seed are actually used on any particular implementation.
	If fewer than 96 bits are used, the bits are taken first from
	src1, then src2, and finally src3.  In each case, bits are
	used from low to high (i.e., if an implementation uses 80 bits,
	all the bits from src1 and src2 are used while the lower 16 bits
	from src3 are used).

	{\tt srand} can only be executed in supervisor mode.
