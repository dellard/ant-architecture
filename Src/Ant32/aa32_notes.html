<dl>

<dt> <font size="+1"><b>-a <em>address</em></b></font> <p>

<dd> Set the base address to the specified <em>address</em>.  The base
	address is the memory location of the first instruction in
	the program. <p>

	The default base address is <kbd>0x80000000</kbd>, which is
	the virtual address corresponding to the start of physical
	memory in the unmapped segment.  <p>

<dt> <font size="+1"><b>-B <em>address</em></b></font> <p>
	
<dd> Set the boot address to the given <em>address</em>.  The default
	boot address, if -B is not used, is the base address.  If -l
	is specified, then this option has no effect.  <p>

<dt> <font size="+1"><b>-l</b></font> <p>

<dd> If -l is specified, the assembler does not add a specification of
	the boot address to the image.  The resulting image is usable
	as a library, or can be loaded into an executing process, but
	cannot be used to boot the machine. <p>
	
	By default, the boot address is included as a special
	directive to the loader to force the hardware to begin
	execution at a particular address.  (see -B for more
	information) <p>

<dt> <font size="+1"><b>-o <em>a32-file</em></b></font> <p>

<dd> Write the output to a file named <em>a32-file</em> instead of the
	default (which is the same name as the input file, with a
	<kbd>.a32</kbd> suffix).  <p>

<dt> <font size="+1"><b>-r <em>a32-file</em></b></font> <p>
	
<dd> Merge the specified <em>a32-file</em> file (which must be a
	<kbd>.a32</kbd> file created by <b>aa32</b>) with the image
	created by assembling the given file.  This option is usually
	used to add a "boot ROM" to the image.  <p>

	Note that -r and -l flag can interact; if the image loaded
	with the -r flag contains a boot jump, that that boot jump
	will be included (and override the default boot jump) in the
	final image whether or not the -l flag is also specified. 
	There is no convenient to override a boot jump address once it
	has been compiled into a library.  <p>

<dt> <font size="+1"><b>-h</b></font> <p>

<dd> Print a terse help message, and then exit. <p>

<dt> <font size="+1"><b>-V</b></font> <p>

<dd> Print the version of the <kbd>aa32</kbd>, and then exit. <p>

</dl>

To assemble an ordinary program: <p>

<pre>
aa32 -r /usr/local/ant32/lib/ant32rom.a32 <em>PROGRAM</em>.asm
</pre> <p>

In this example, <kbd>ant32rom.a32</kbd> is the standard boot-ROM used
to initialize the system, which is supplied as part of the Ant-32
distribution.  (The path to where this file is located on your system
depends upon the details of your installation.) <p>

See the section below about how to assemble a boot ROM for directions
on how to create an appropriate .a32 file.  <p>

To assemble a stand-alone bootable program, no flags are needed:
<p>

<pre>
	aa32 <em>PROGRAM</em>.asm
</pre> <p>

If the image is intended to be loaded into a piece of memory that
starts somewhere other than 0x80000000, then the -a flag (and possibly
the -B flag) should be used.  Note that although any address can be
specified with the -a and -B options, it only makes sense to specify a
virtual address in an unmapped segment and which translates to a valid
piece of physical memory.  <p>

The default Ant-32 machine has four contiguous megabytes of RAM,
starting at physical address 0 (virtual address 0x80000000), and 16
kilobytes of ROM at the highest addresses in physical memory (virtual
address 0xbfffc000, or physical 0x3fffc000).  <p>

Creating a boot ROM is a special case of creating a stand-alone
bootable program.  The only difference is using the -a flag to specify
that the program should assemble into the ROM.  For example:  <p>

<pre>
	aa32 -a 0xbfffc000 <em>ROM</em>.asm
</pre>

This will create an image named <em>ROM</em> that begins at virtual
memory address 0xbfffc000, and is also initialized to begin execution
at this address.  <p>
