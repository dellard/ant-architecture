# The Ant8 and Ant32 architectures

The original Ant architecture including the original ant8 and
ant32 versions.

This is a snapshot of the development version circa 3.1b.
This version has been renamed as 3.1-20200623.

Version 3.1-20200623 contains at least a
bugs, especially in the GUI,
that were believed to have been fixed in the
release of 3.1b, but archives of that code have been lost.

## Description

The Ant architecture was intended to be a simple example architecture
that could be used to teach the basics of RISC computer architeture,
including how to write assembly language programs, how to write
an assembler and compiler, how to implement virtual memory, and
how implement an architecture in physical hardware (using VHDL).

## Contributors

The first implementation of the assembler, debugger, and virtual
machine for Ant8 was done by Daniel Ellard and James Megquier.  The
Ant32 implementation was done by Daniel Ellard, David Holland, and
Sara Susskind.  Most of the TCL-based GUIs for both Ant8 and Ant32
were written by Sara Susskind.  Penelope Ellard made significant
contributions to the tutorial documentation, particularly for Ant32.
A number of other people contributed to the codebase and the examples.

Development of the Ant architecture was supported by Microsoft,
Apple Computer, and the National Science Foundation.
